Overview\nAn issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.\n\n## References\n- [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18276)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff)\n- [MISC](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155498/Bash-5.0-Patch-11-Privilege-Escalation.html)\n- [MISC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8)\n- [Ubuntu CVE Tracker](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18276)\n","cvssScore":8.4,"type":"deb","cvss":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F","cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":["CWE-273"],"package":"bash","source":"ruby:2.7.0-slim"},{"id":"SNYK-DEBIAN10-COREUTILS-317465","title":"Improper Input Validation","name":"coreutils","version":"8.30-3","severity":"low","description":"## Overview\nchroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer.\n\n## References\n- [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2781)\n- [OSS security Advisory](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/02/28/2)\n- [OSS security Advisory](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/02/28/3)\n- [Ubuntu CVE Tracker](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2781)\n","cvssScore":6.5,"type":"deb","cvss":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","cve":"CVE-2016-2781","cwe":["CWE-20"],"package":"coreutils","source":"ruby:2.7.0-slim"},{"id":"SNYK-DEBIAN10-COREUTILS-317494","title":"Race Condition","name":"coreutils","version":"8.30-3","severity":"low","description":"## Overview\nIn GNU Coreutils through 8.29, chown-core.c in chown and chgrp does not prevent replacement of a plain file with a symlink during use of the POSIX \"-R -L\" options, which allows local users to modify the ownership of arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition.\n\n## References\n- [CVE Details](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18018)\n- [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18018)\n- [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/coreutils/2017-12/msg00045.html](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/coreutils/2017-12/msg00045.html)\n","cvssScore":4.7,"type":"deb","cvss":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","cve":"CVE-2017-18018","cwe":["CWE-362"],"package":"coreutils","source":"ruby:2.7.0-slim"},{"id":"SNYK-DEBIAN10-GCC8-347558","title":"Information Exposure","name":"gcc-8/libstdc++6","version":"8.3.0-6","severity":"medium","description":"## Overview\nstack_protect_prologue in cfgexpand.c and stack_protect_epilogue in function.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.1 through 8 (under certain circumstances) generate instruction sequences when targeting ARM targets that spill the address of the stack protector guard, which allows an attacker to bypass the protection of -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong, and -fstack-protector-explicit against stack overflow by controlling what the stack canary is compared against.\n\n## References\n- [CONFIRM](https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/gcc/config/arm/arm-protos.h?revision=266379&view=markup)\n- [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12886)\n- [MISC](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-8/changes.html)\n","cvssScore":8.1,"type":"deb","cvss":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","cve":"CVE-2018-12886","cwe":["CWE-119","CWE-209"],"package":"gcc-8","source":"ruby:2.7.0-slim"},{"id":"SNYK-DEBIAN10-GCC8-469413","title":"Insufficient Entropy","name":"gcc-8/libstdc++6","version":"8.3.0-6","severity":"low","description":"## Overview\nThe POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator.

Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).\n\n## References\n- [ADVISORY](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1551)\n- [Bugtraq Mailing List](https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/39)\n- [Bugtraq Mailing List](https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/46)\n- [CONFIRM](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=419102400a2811582a7a3d4a4e317d72e5ce0a8f)\n- [CONFIRM](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=f1c5eea8a817075d31e43f5876993c6710238c98)\n- [CONFIRM](https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09)\n- [CONFIRM](https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-03)\n- [Debian Security Advisory](https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4594)\n- [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1551)\n- [FEDORA](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDHOAATPWJCXRNFMJ2SASDBBNU5RJONY/)\n- [FEDORA](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EXDDAOWSAIEFQNBHWYE6PPYFV4QXGMCD/)\n- [FEDORA](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XVEP3LAK4JSPRXFO4QF4GG2IVXADV3SO/)\n- [GENTOO](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-10)\n- [MISC](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155754/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html)\n- [MISC](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html)\n- [Netapp Security Advisory](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191210-0001/)\n- [OpenSSL Security Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt)\n- [OpenSuse Security Announcement](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00030.html)\n- [UBUNTU](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/)\n- [Ubuntu CVE Tracker](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-1551)\n","cvssScore":5.3,"type":"deb","cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","cve":"CVE-2019-1551","cwe":["CWE-200"],"package":"openssl","source":"ruby:2.7.0-slim"},{"id":"SNYK-DEBIAN10-OPENSSL-567125","title":"NULL Pointer Dereference","name":"openssl/libssl-dev","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u2","severity":"low","description":"## Overview\nServer or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the \"signature_algorithms_cert\" TLS extension.
